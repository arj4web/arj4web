## Hello Visitors, Welcome to Aditya's Profile &nbsp;

I am Aditya Ranjan Jha (aka ARJ). I am a second-year doctoral student pursuing research in computer science and engineering. 

I am interested in learning about computers in general. Right now, I haven't figured out what I like particularly, so I am skimming my feet in all rivers.

I am lucky to have graduated with the best bunch of peers and friends from IIT Kharagpur. A large bunch of my personal traits belong to that ecosystem.
